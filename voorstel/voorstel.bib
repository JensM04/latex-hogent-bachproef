  abstract     = {This paper addresses graveyards as a context for designing interactive technology, especially pervasive displays and the presentation of information related to graves and the dead. We present our research containing three user studies: a focus group-based study on perceptions of different display technologies in the cemetery context, evaluation of a gravestone display prototype, and a user study with a graveyard navigator prototype. Whereas, HCI research surrounding death has so far largely focused on an individual’s digital remains, our focus is on the physical graveyard setting. We contribute to understanding the potential impacts and opportunities of interactive technology in this design context. Our salient findings highlight the cultural sensitivity and importance of dignity related to the context, unobtrusiveness of the technology, and concerns for privacy and social acceptability. Concepts taking into account these design aspects were of interest for those researching family histories, and visitors seeking improved navigation for the graveyard.},

  abstract     = {Spatial computing in augmented reality (AR) overlays digital information into users' view or immediate physical space, enhancing how we interact with our surroundings. It holds promise for pedestrian navigation, whether it is safety-critical or requires multi-tasking and real-time spatial information processing. Our systematic review of 79 articles delves into AR pedestrian navigation, covering device types, tracking methods, information taxonomy, and an evaluation of both technical and human factors. We highlight trends and future research directions, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners in identifying suitable techniques and designs that serve their applications and spurring innovation in adaptable systems and design concepts.
